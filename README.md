# Steganography
This steganography project aims to allow Tom and I the ability to showcase our coding skills and how they evolve over time. The project/website is in a very basic form right now and we will be expanding on it as time goes on.

Currently we are working on getting the initial functionality in place: working webpage and javascript to allow the user to input an image from their device for en/decoding.
